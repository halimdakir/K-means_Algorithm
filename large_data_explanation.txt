We included a dataset named big-data_1M.txt in the submission file. This dataset contains 1 million data points, which we consider large because processing it took approximately 30 minutes to complete using our program. Additionally, we attempted to test the program with a dataset containing 10 million data points, but the execution time was so lengthy that we could not complete the process. You can verify the program's performance using the big-data_1M.txt dataset provided.
